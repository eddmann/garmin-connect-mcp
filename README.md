## Overview

This MCP server provides 73 tools to interact with your Garmin Connect account, organized into 11 categories:

- Activities, Health & Wellness, Training, Challenges, Devices, Weight, Workouts, Gear, Data Management, Women's Health, and User Profile.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), OR
- Docker

## Installation & Setup

### How Authentication Works

1. **First Run**: Server authenticates with your Garmin Connect credentials
2. **MFA Support**: If enabled, prompts for your MFA code (interactive stdin)
3. **Token Storage**: OAuth tokens saved to `~/.garminconnect/` and automatically refreshed
4. **UV**: Tokens persist across runs
5. **Docker**: Tokens are ephemeral (container authenticates on each restart)

### Option 1: Using UV

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd my-garmin-connect-mcp
uv sync
```

Then configure credentials using one of these methods:

#### Interactive Setup

```bash
uv run garmin-connect-mcp-auth
```

This will prompt for your credentials (and MFA code if needed) and save them to `.env`.

#### Manual Setup

Create a `.env` file manually:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Option 2: Using Docker

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest
```

Then configure credentials using one of these methods:

#### Interactive Setup

```bash
# Create the env file first (Docker will create it as a directory if it doesn't exist)
touch garmin-connect-mcp.env

# Run the setup script
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/garmin-connect-mcp.env:/app/.env" \
  --entrypoint= \
  ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest \
  python -m garmin_connect_mcp.scripts.setup_auth
```

This will prompt for your credentials and save them to `garmin-connect-mcp.env`.

#### Manual Setup

Create a `garmin-connect-mcp.env` file manually in your current directory:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your configuration file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Using UV

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/my-garmin-connect-mcp",
        "garmin-connect-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/garmin-connect-mcp.env:/app/.env",
        "ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Ask Claude to interact with your Garmin data using natural language:

### Activities

```
"Show me my activities from last week"
"What were the details of my last run?"
"Show me split data for activity 12345678"
"What was the weather during my morning ride?"
```

### Health & Wellness

```
"How did I sleep last night?"
"What's my Body Battery level today?"
"Show me my stress levels for yesterday"
"What's my resting heart rate this week?"
```

### Training

```
"What's my VO2 max progress this month?"
"Show me my hill score for the last 30 days"
"What are my current race predictions?"
"Show me my HRV data for today"
```

### Devices & Gear

```
"List all my Garmin devices"
"What's my primary training device?"
"Show me solar charging data for my watch"
```

### Challenges & Goals

```
"Show me my active challenges"
"What badges have I earned?"
"Show me my personal records"
```

### Data Management

```
"Add a weigh-in of 75kg"
"Record my blood pressure: 120/80"
"Add 500ml of water to my hydration log"
```
